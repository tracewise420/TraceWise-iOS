SDK Setup for Web, Android, and iOS

The goal is to provide cross-platform SDKs that allow seamless communication with your backend (via API), including authentication, product registration, event tracking, and lifecycle management. We’ll focus on building type-safe SDKs for Web (JS/TS), Android (Kotlin), and iOS (Swift), which wrap the existing API endpoints.

Requirements and deliverables:

Web SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript)
Repo: sdk-js
Features:
Typed methods for interacting with the backend
JWT token injection (via Firebase Auth)
API request retries with exponential backoff (for errors like 5xx, 429)
User-friendly error handling (with proper error codes)
Auth state management (session token persistence, Firebase Auth)
Base URL configuration for environment-specific APIs
Documentation with usage examples
Test cases for key methods
Methods (for each):
getProduct({ gtin, serial })
registerProductToUser({ userId, product })
addLifecycleEvent({ gtin, serial, eventType, timestamp, details })
getProductEvents({ id, limit?, pageToken? })
getCirpassProduct({ id }) (optional)

Tooling:
Build with ESM and CJS (tree-shakable for optimal import size)
Bundled via Rollup or tsup
Use Jest/Mocha for unit tests
Publish via npm (ensure semantic versioning)

Android SDK (Kotlin)
Repo: tracewise-sdk
Features:
Retrofit-based client to consume REST API
Typed data models (with Kotlin’s data class)
JWT token injection (Firebase Auth)
Auth state persistence in app (SharedPreferences or other secure storage)
Retry logic with exponential backoff
Error handling based on status codes (e.g., 5xx, 429)
Subscription management (free tier, paid tier) + rate limiting
Unit and integration tests (covering major methods)
Documentation with setup guide and sample usage
Publish to Maven Central or GitHub Packages

Methods:
getProduct(gtin: String, serial: String?)
registerProduct(userId: String, product: Product)
addLifecycleEvent(event: LifecycleEvent)
getProductEvents(id: String, limit: Int, pageToken: String?)
getCirpassProduct(id: String) (optional)
Subscription management via API (based on user tier)

Tooling:
Retrofit + OkHttp for HTTP requests
Kotlin Coroutines for async code
Firebase SDK for Auth integration
Unit tests with JUnit, Mockito

iOS SDK (Swift)
Repo: TraceWise-iOS
Features:
URLSession-based API client with Codable models
Firebase Auth integration for token-based API calls
Handle retries for 5xx errors, rate limits
Auth token persistence (secure storage)
Subscription management support (tiered)
Support for JSON and ID token headers (JWT)
Unit and integration tests
Documentation with example code
Publish via CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager

Methods:
getProduct(gtin: String, serial: String?)
registerProduct(userId: String, product: Product)
addLifecycleEvent(event: LifecycleEvent)
getProductEvents(id: String, limit: Int, pageToken: String?)
getCirpassProduct(id: String) (optional)
Subscription tier info (with checks for limits)
Tooling:
URLSession for API calls
Codable structs for JSON parsing
Firebase SDK for Authentication
Unit tests with XCTest

2) Acceptance Criteria for All SDKs
Functionality
SDK should allow full interaction with the backend (product registration, event logging, fetching lifecycle data).
Authentication is handled via Firebase Auth (token is included in each request).
SDKs must support retries with exponential backoff for error codes like 5xx and 429.
Rate limiting and tiering (subscription-based usage) should be clearly documented and enforced.
API Compatibility
The SDK methods must directly correspond to the backend API endpoints in the latest version (both staging and production environments).
Each method should include proper error handling for common failures (e.g., expired tokens, network issues, invalid input).
Documentation
Full README for each SDK with detailed examples of how to use each function.
Step-by-step setup guide (including Firebase Auth integration for each platform).
Examples of common use cases (e.g., product registration, lifecycle events, fetching events).
Publishing instructions for distributing SDKs (npm, Maven, CocoaPods).
Testing
Unit tests must cover all functions (e.g., getProduct(), registerProduct(), addLifecycleEvent()).
Integration tests to verify real API calls (mock responses where applicable).
Tests should be automated in CI pipelines.
Performance
SDK should be efficient (low network calls, minimal memory usage).
Handle high-frequency use cases like multiple product registrations in a short time window.
Error Handling
Clear error codes and descriptions for every failure (e.g., NETWORK_ERROR, INVALID_INPUT, SERVER_ERROR).
The SDK should propagate useful error information to the app developers.

Next Steps / Features for SDKs

Step 1: Web SDK (JS/TS)

Action:
Set up the npm package and basic structure.
Implement the core functions (API methods: product registration, event tracking).
Integrate Firebase Auth for token management.
Implement retry and backoff mechanisms for API requests.
Write unit and integration tests.
Publish the package to npm.

Step 2: Android SDK (Kotlin)
Action:
Set up the project, define Retrofit + OkHttp client.
Implement core functions (API calls, retries, event tracking).
Integrate Firebase Auth for token management.
Implement subscription and tier checks (API-based).
Write unit and integration tests.
Publish to Maven Central or GitHub Packages.

Step 3: iOS SDK (Swift)

Action:
Set up the project, define URLSession client.
Implement core methods (API calls, retries, event logging).
Integrate Firebase Auth for token management.
Implement subscription checks (tiered usage limits).
Write unit tests and integrate with CI.
Publish to CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.

4) Subscription & Usage Limits
For managing usage limits (tiered subscriptions), you’ll want to do the following:
Tier Management:
Define free and paid tiers (you could expose this in Firebase Firestore).
Free tier: limited to a certain number of product registrations or lifecycle events per day/month.
Paid tier: No limits, or higher limits.
API Rate Limiting:
Track the number of API calls per tier (Firestor-based tracking).
Implement rate limiting for free-tier users, and potentially usage-based pricing for paid tiers.

Quota Enforcement:
Cloud Run can support quotas via Firebase Authentication custom claims (e.g., free_user=true).
Enforce limits at the backend level, rejecting requests for users exceeding their tier limits.

5) Testing & Release Workflow
Testing
Test unit tests locally with Jest (Web SDK) or Xcode/Android Studio for mobile SDKs.
Set up mock API responses in the SDK (i.e., mock network calls during testing).
Add end-to-end tests (real API calls, but rate-limited to avoid hitting production data).
Automate test execution with CI (GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
Release Workflow
Versioning: Follow Semantic Versioning (major, minor, patch).
CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions to automatically:
Lint the code
Run tests
Build the SDK
Publish to npm / Maven / CocoaPods on each tag release
Auto-generate changelogs
Add a manual approval step before major version releases (with changelog review).

Next Actions
Start with Web SDK development and share initial feedback after setup.
Implement mobile SDKs based on the Web SDK blueprint, adapting to platform-specific requirements.
Ensure real-world testing by interacting with the API as an end user.

So basically, instead of writing:

fetch("https://api.tracewise.io/v1/products?gtin=04012345678905")

a dev can just call:

const product = await tw.products.get({ gtin: "04012345678905" });
